    <h1>Chicago Bears</h1>
    <p>"Kmet is as classic a tight end as you'll see, which allows recently signed veteran Jimmy Graham to play more of a receiving role. And don't be surprised if the Bears go with more three-tight end sets this season. Creative offensive architect Matt Nagy understands that those packages make a defense slower and more predictable, and with ex-Chief Demetrius Harris already aboard, Kmet now gives this team three tight ends who can align almost anywhere as receivers" (Mayer, 2020).</p>
    <p>"PFF was especially high on second-round cornerback Jaylon Johnson, with Mike Remmer writing: "Johnson is one of the most instinctual corners in the entire draft, and he goes to a landing spot in Chicago where that ability can thrive. We saw Johnson's grades improve every single year of his college career after he saw 506 snaps as a true freshman back in 2017. In his final seven games with Utah, Johnson allowed only 112 yards combined" (Mayer, 2020).
